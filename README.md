# DisSender
A Java Netbeans project to send Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) Entity State Protocol Data Units (PDUs) to a broadcast address destination. With relative ease it may also send other PDU types. 

The program was developed in Netbeats with ant. You should run it in conjuction with DisReceiver, another git repository, which reads broadcast UDP traffic. See https://github.com/mcgredonps/DisReceiver
